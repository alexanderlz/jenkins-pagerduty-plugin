  This is an alternate summary text, that can be passed onto Pager duty change events. If omitted it will default to current build's fullDisplayName.  Token macro substitution is enabled for this field, but must use the form ${ENV, var="token"}.  Ex. Build completed for ${ENV, var="my_build_product"}
